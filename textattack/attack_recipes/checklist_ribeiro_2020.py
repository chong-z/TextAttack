    """An implementation of the attack used in "Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral
    Testing of NLP models with CheckList", Ribeiro et al., 2020.".
    This attack focuses on a number of attacks used in the Invariance Testing
    Method:
        - Contraction
        - Extension
        - Changing Names, Number, Location
        - possibly negation (not yet implemented)
    The idea is to alter elements of the sentence without actually changing the semantic of the sentence
